- faster way of sending common, regular queries -- this i can rate 
	- is this via -- a present query in a file, so running sqlite3 database.db < file.sql
		- could have a couple diff queries in files in the folder, think that works well - maybe running via python, if possible to access functions in a .py doc from the terminal? - advantage of this is some variables that can enter via command line, ex. notes with > X words - would pass in the x via terminal

- interface for seeing results of queries  -- not super important, can have it create an html file 
	- could have a .py file that wraps each output piece in relevant html tags
	- and then having a constructor for those results? in which case a .py file is helpful


what is the file structure like?
