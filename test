#set -x # this will echo all the commands ... but it puts a + sign in front, not super aesthetic
# set - sets the option, set + unsets it ... so just run it at the right spot


# SECTION 1

#option 1 -- this works, commenting it out for clarity in testing rn
	# set -x
	# ls \"$1\"
	# set +x

#option 2 - using a function

#echo "OK, 2nd option now line\n"

echo_me() {
	echo $@
	$@
}

#echo_me ls \"$1\" # might need to wrap in quotes - but looks fine w/o

# so, problem here is that it doesn't execute including the quotations -- whereas option 1 does ... 
# set -x is perf here ... but aesthetics ... ... set -x also works well when the stuff you want to print is at end of file, otherwise set +x shows up 


# SECTION 2 - TESTING W/git
echo "OK, section 2 now \n"

echo_me git add -A
echo_me git commit -m \"$1\"
echo_me git push origin master
